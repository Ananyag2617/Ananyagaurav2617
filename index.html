༺༻ HELLO! WELCOME TO MY FASTPAGES BLOG!!! ༺༻


What did the computer programmer say to his professor when he was unable to submit his coding assignment? 
The student said, "My dog ate my assignment. However, it did take him a couple of bytes to finish it".

## Introduction to Web Development
> Websites are made up of three key parts: Frontend, Backend, and Deployment.  The focus for these weeks is to enable students to perform all the aspects of constructing constructing and deploying a Website.  Fastpages got us started on these concepts, but now we will build a Website from the ground up.   Once again, there will be a lot of learning focused tools and getting things working.  But, in the end, students will be ready to learn all aspects of Website Development.
