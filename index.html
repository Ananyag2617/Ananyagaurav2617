## Introduction to Web Development
> Websites are made up of three key parts: Frontend, Backend, and Deployment.  The focus for these weeks is to enable students to perform all the aspects of constructing constructing and deploying a Website.  Fastpages got us started on these concepts, but now we will build a Website from the ground up.   Once again, there will be a lot of learning focused tools and getting things working.  But, in the end, students will be ready to learn all aspects of Website Development.
