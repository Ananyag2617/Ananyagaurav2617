In middle school I took programming as my elective and did that for two years. When the pandemic hit, thats when I started getting serious about programming and learned the basics of python. My dad taught many things and also gave me resoucres such as udemy and w3schools. I also took online classes with my friends where we did little projects togetehr and showed off our skills. . Taking this class and what I have leanred . Although I had already leanred lists, dictionaries, tuples, ect, there were still many things that I have learned so far. I didn&#39;t know anything about github or vscode. After taking this class, I have learned how to make my own blog and commit changes. This week I learned how to make changes without commiting the changes I make on vscode. I am really excited to see what I learn as the weeks go on, because I quite surprised with what I have learned in these past weeks, .",

When we loop through a dictionary, we can also decide if we want just the values or the keys printed. Lets say that we want just the keys of the dictionary to be printed, we would have to type . for a in dictionaryname.keys(): print(a) .

Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | Notes: . The main difference between primitive and reference type is that primitive type always has a value, it can never be null but reference type can be null, which denotes the absence of value. | Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name. | . print(&quot;Hi!

List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;Name&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nickname:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nickname&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nationality:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nationality&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Born?:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Born?&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Eye_Color:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Eye_Color&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite_Food:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Favorite_Food&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Sibling:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Sibling&quot;]) print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in peopleInfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Ananya Nickname: Aisha Age: 15 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pasta Sibling: Rashi, Rashi Nickname: Gauri Age: 11 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pizza Sibling: Ananya, . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(peopleInfoDb): record = peopleInfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Ananya Nickname: Aisha Age: 15 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pasta Sibling: Rashi, Rashi Nickname: Gauri Age: 11 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pizza Sibling: Ananya, . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(peopleInfoDb): record = peopleInfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Ananya Nickname: Aisha Age: 15 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pasta Sibling: Rashi, Rashi Nickname: Gauri Age: 11 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pizza Sibling: Ananya, .

            "content": "Basic vocabulary of Version Control . Few basic terms that are used often when discussing about version control (not exhaustive). . Repository = a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example). . | Commit = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms ‘commit’ or ‘checkin’ can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing. . | Revision / version = A revision or a version is any change in made in any form to a document(s). Clone = Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions. . | Pull / push = Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update. . | Merge = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. . | . Python Data Types . Variable is a way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define. . Data types . Integer (int) = Whole number | Float (float) = Decimal number | String (str) = Text | Boolean (bool) = True / False | List (list) = A “container” that can store any kind of values. You can create a list with square brackets e.g. [1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]. | Tuple (tuple) = A similar “container” as list with a difference that you cannot update the values in a tuple. You can create a tuple with parentheses (1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;). | . | .",

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string print(&quot;What is the variable name/key?&quot;, &quot;value?&quot;, &quot;type?&quot;, &quot;primitive or collection, why?&quot;) name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) print() # variable of type integer print(&quot;What is the variable name/key?&quot;, &quot;value?&quot;, &quot;type?&quot;, &quot;primitive or collection, why?&quot;) age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) print() # variable of type float print(&quot;What is the variable name/key?&quot;, &quot;value?&quot;, &quot;type?&quot;, &quot;primitive or collection, why?&quot;) score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) print(&quot;What is variable name/key?&quot;, &quot;value?&quot;, &quot;type?&quot;, &quot;primitive or collection?&quot;) print(&quot;What is different about the list output?&quot;) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs), &quot;length&quot;, len(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) print(&quot;What is the variable name/key?&quot;, &quot;value?&quot;, &quot;type?&quot;, &quot;primitive or collection, why?&quot;) print(&quot;What is different about the dictionary output?&quot;) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person), &quot;length&quot;, len(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) .

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Mortensen&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;October 21&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;jmortensen@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;2015-Fusion&#39;, &#39;2011-Ranger&#39;, &#39;2003-Excursion&#39;, &#39;1997-F350&#39;, &#39;1969-Cadillac&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Sunny&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Naidu&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;August 2&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Temecula&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;snaidu@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;4Runner&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner .",

At the end of Weeks 0-3, students will be exposed to blogging with GitHub Pages; developing with Jupyter Notebooks, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and Code.org AppLab; working with AP classroom and becoming familiar with Create Performance Task project requirements. . Introduction to Web Development . Websites are made up of three key parts: Frontend, Backend, and Deployment. The focus for these weeks is to enable students to perform all the aspects of constructing constructing and deploying a Website. Fastpages got us started on these concepts, but now we will build a Website from the ground up. Once again, there will be a lot of learning focused tools and getting things working. But, in the end, students will be ready to learn all aspects of Website Development. . Fundamental of Programming and Algorithms . The tough solutions to problems in Computer Science generally require an algorithm. Each algorithm usually involves data, for instance Data Science is a field that focuses on data with algorithms. The next few week focuses on some very detailed algorithms, but we hope to express these details visually with our Web and Blogging capabilities. Data and binary are sometimes considered boring, but we produce data with analytics or learn to alter the internals of images, the data and algorithms can become VERY interesting. .",

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . My hobbies .
