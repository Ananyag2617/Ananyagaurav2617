After arriving at the classroom, me and my team worked on our project a little bit, because we were having trouble with our game and because we were going to be presenting. Screenshots: . After we presented our game, I went back to the classroom and looked at other people’s projects. . Projects I looked at . Project 1 . The first one that I looked at was this emotion test project. Basically you choose an emotion you are feeling and it outputs songs according to your emotion. I really liked this project, because I really liked the idea of it and I was amazed with the songs that came out. . Project 2 . The second project I looked at was a group from my class. They built a dictionary, and they had a search bar where you could eneter the word and it would output the defination. I also liked that they had a word of the day that changed everyday. . Art pieces from different classes . After looking at a few projects around the classroom, me and ekam went to the 3D animation, ceramics, studio art,drawing and painting classrooms to view all the amazing artwork the students had created. As I was going around looking at the different pieces of artwork, I was really inspired and it made me want to join the class too. After seeing all the art, I am definalty going to be taking an art class next year. Here are the some of the pieces we saw. . Art 1 . . Art 2 . . Art 3 . . Art 4 . . Art 5 . . Art 6 . . Art 7 . . Art 8 . . Ideas for next tri . Some ideas I have for next tri are: . math calculator | personality quiz | GPA calculator | a game, maybe hangman | guess the word quiz | 20 questions game | . What are some things I would improve? . For this tri, my team did a great job, we had great frontend coding, however our backend part was a little hard. We were having trouble connecting the frontend with the backend. For next time, I am going to plan things better, and not procrasinate. I will also talk to my future team to have meetings outside of school once in a while. .",

            "content": "Lesson 3.16 . Here are some notes and essential knowledge for simulations! . Objective: How we use computers to reflect real world phenomena via simulations. . Key Points: . Computer simulations can be limited and have bias . Example: We can assume that when a car is moving, there will be people in it, which is a proper bias to make. But, a simulation may have a bias on which cars will be chosen to simulate a crash. | Computer simulation examples: games | rolling dice | spinners | Molecular models | Analyze chemicals/reactions | For air traffic control To test and find what is the optimal number of aircrafts that should be in the air at once. ### Simulations | . | . | Will not always have the same result | They investigate a phenomenon without real-world constraints of time, money, or safety | Holding a real experiment would most likely result in more accurate results | A simulation can model real-world events that aren’t practical to hold experiments for Ex. the air traffic control example-- not very safe or practical to hold an experiment with expensive and dangerous equipment ### Question 1 An environmental researcher has been conducting a study on the population of hawks in the area in order to predict the number of hawks that will occur in the upcoming year. She created a computer model using data from the past five years. The simulation predicted 42 hawks in the area, but only 29 appeared. Which of the following strategies will be the LEAST likely to offer a more accurate result? | Gathering more data from previous years | Consider adding more data on other species in the area | Taking into consideration changing weather pattern in the area | Remove more data and calculations so the simulation can run faster ### Recap | Simulations are abstractions of complex situations done for a specific purpose | Simulations provide opportunities to study and make predictions when experiments are not feasible for many reasons to include: cost, safely, and accessibility | A simulation uses and represents varying sets of data to reflect the changing state of a phenomenon | Developing abstract simulations involve removing details or simplifying functionality | Simulations can be done without the constraints of the real-world | Simulations can have bias | Simulations can refine previous results and hypothesis ### Question 2 The transportation department would like to build an elevated train system that will route through 3 cities. The transportation department wants to administer a simulation of this train system before construction begins. WHich of the following statements is true about the use of this simulation for the project? | The simulation may reveal possible safety issues that can be corrected before construction begins | The simulation is not needed because other elevated train systems exist. | A simulation cannot be used to test the train system in different weather conditions | The simulation will add high costs to the project. ### Question 3 Which of the following scenarios would be the LEAST beneficial to have as a simulation? | A retail company wants to identity the item which sold the most on their website | A restaurant wants to determine if the use of robots will increase efficiency | A sports bike company wants to study design changes to their new bike design | . Plan . Talk about what similulations are, essential key points, and why and how they are used. What makes these a simulation? | What are the simplifications they make? Why? | What are the assumptions? | What are the benefits of running a simulation over the real thing? | What are the detriments? | How can you get closer to the “actual” results? | . | Show how simualtions can recreate an aspect of our physical world with examples | Watch a video? | Show them a few sample simulations | Hacks . Make a copy of this post into your own repository. We are going to have everyone make a copy of this notebook so they can always refer back to it. | Complete the MC questions WITH an explanation for your answer.

            "title": "Final Results and Reflection",
            "content": "This is the result I got after taking the final test. . Screenshots: . Questions I missed . These are the questions I missed on the test. I missed a total of 9 questions, there were times when I didn’t understand or know the answer to some questions, so I would go back to the collegeboard lessons and review the topic. After taking the test, I realized that I didn’t struggle much on the questions that involved code and the basics of coding. . Screenshots: . Question 2 . For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong because when x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. The correct answer is C because when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and the value of y is displayed. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. . . Question 3 . For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong because collaboration that includes diverse backgrounds and perspectives can reflect the strengths of the individual team members. The correct answer is A because the need for software testing is not eliminated, even with effective collaborators. Testing ensures that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. . . Question 4 . For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong the usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists are not needed. Since Alejandra is organizing the meal, only her contact list is used.The correct answer is A because each group member’s list of food allergies or dietary restrictions is needed for the application to determine which restaurants can accommodate all members of the group. Alejandra’s geographic location is needed so that the application can determine which restaurants are nearby. The usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists are not needed. Since Alejandra is organizing the meal, only her contact list is used. . . Question 8 . For this question I put A as my answer. This answer is wrong because the value of j does not need to be between 0 and k. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive. The correct answer is B because the procedure creates a copy of numList called newList. The element at newList[j] is assigned the element at numList[k], and the element at newList[k] is assigned the element at numList[j]. Therefore, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements at indices j and k are interchanged. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive. . . Question 14 . For this question we had to pick two answers and I only picked one (B) which was one of the right answers. The other right answer is D. These two answers are right because when numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed instead of the intended “check minus” and when numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore “check minus” is displayed instead of the intended “check plus”. . . Question 18 . For this question I picked B which is wrong because the Internet is not a data stream. The right answer is C because the Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet. . . Question 35 . For this question we had to pick two answers but I picked only one of the right answers which was A I believe, the other right answer was D. These two are right because this code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120 and plus this code segment uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. . . Question 39 . For this question I kind of rushed and misread the question. I picked B, but this is wrong because while the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. The correct answer is D because list indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. . . Question 49 . For this question I picked the answer B, but this is wrong because this code segment produces the string “onon”. The correct answer is C because this code segment assigns “on” to word. It then concatenates the reverse of word (“no”) with word (“on”), producing the intended string “noon”. . . These were all the question I got wrong. Now in this section of the blog I will be going through the test one more time and explore topics I had trouble understanding. . What are binary numbers? . A Binary Number is made up of only 0s and 1s. For example: . 110100 . This number above is a binary number! FACT: There is no 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 in Binary! Binary numbers have many uses in mathematics and beyond. . Binary Numbers Table . . The Internet . Around 1975, huge computers still existed, amd people thought of the internet As time evolved, smaller computers were made. | Computing devices like our routers, motion sensors, and laptops | Computer users wanted to communicate to each other somehow through the use of internet | Computers understand electrons; electrons are represented by number systems (binary, octal, decimal, etc) | Packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information | A computer system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data (a computer network is a type of computing system) | Packet Switching: The message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device | Routing is the process of path selection in any network | Bandwidth is the range of frequencies or maximum amount that can be sent on a computer network (like on zoom) | bandwidth measured in bits per second | .

Show me the code.” | “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” | &quot;Microsoft isn’t evil; they just make really crappy operating systems.&quot; | . Terms and Usage . A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git). | A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes. | A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database. Git commits over time are a series of Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA’s). This is the math behind a git snapshot. | The .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree (ie files constructed from source or derived files, like ipynb files that turn into md files). | The “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository. | To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable. | Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository. | A “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch. | . Questions to ask within the team . What is the main repository for your project? | Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance. | Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base? | Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? Creating Issues | Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create - Pull Request | Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? - Link Issue to PR | Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?

For example, a program outputs a result different from the expected value, like saying that three times three equals thirty-three. . Syntax Errors: . A syntax error occurs when the rules of the programming language aren&#39;t followed. Any typos in your code, such as forgetting to close a parentheses or spelling a variable wrong, will cause an error. Fortunately, many code editors will point out syntax errors, making them one of the easier errors to solve. . Run-Time Errors: . An error that occurs when the program is running. You&#39;ll be able to start your program if you have a run-time error, but something will go wrong when you&#39;re trying to use it. Logic errors are examples of run-time errors. . Overflow Errors: . An error that occurs when a computer tries to handle a number that&#39;s outside of its defined range of values. Usually, this means that your computer&#39;s trying to handle a number too big for it . How to fix errors . Here are some effective ways to identify, find and correct errors. Good testing procedures include testing with valid and invalid data. You want to make sure your program works with valid data and knows what to do if invalid data is imputed. | You should also test boundary cases, or values on the edge of program limits. This is where errors are likely to happen. For example, if your program only accepts values less than 9, you would check 8 and 10 as boundary cases. | . | Hand tracing, or manually tracking what values your variables have as your program goes along. Many hand tracing methods use charts to organize these values. | Using debuggers, or programs designed specially to test for bugs | Adding extra print statements to your code to make sure that the &quot;invisible&quot; steps (the ones that aren&#39;t shown as output) are working properly. | .",

Key Points . 1.3: Daily Video 1In this video, we will learn that computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose. | 1.3: Daily Video 2In this video, we will learn that programs are developed by groups of people and new programs are often written by expanding on the programs already written by others. | 1.3: Daily Video 3In this video, we will learn that programmers use comments and/or documentation to explain the purpose of their program code to themselves, collaborators, and others. | . Key Takeaways . A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature. | There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: | § investigating and reflecting | § designing | § prototyping | § testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process | A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program | Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observation | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and functional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . Topic 1.3, Daily Video 2 . - Acknowledge someone who created the code segment you’re building off of - Programs are rarely solo endeavors - Write their name or origin in documentation or comments - Many times developers use code segments, algorithms, procedures, and more that are written by others - Similar to quoting in research papers - If you’re using someone else’s code segment for your program, acknowledge and quote that author’s name or origin in documentation or comments as it is their intellectual property . Topic 1.3, Daily Video 3 . Programs are created by: - describe the overall program - list program specifications describe: - functions/procedures/methods within the code - specific code segments - list of events and corresponding outputs - the development of the program - how other programs may interact with the code - List of contributors/authors of the other programs - Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: - At the beginning: list specifications - During: to keep track of the process - After: to explain the overall process - Documentation throughout can improve: - Efficiency of overall programing process - Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program - Programmers’ response to bugs and errors - How do programmers document while programming? - Commenting feature - commenting is only featured and allows in some programming languages - commenting doesn’t affect code or text . Summaries from Videos . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required. | It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author’s name | . Ways Programmers Investigate: . collecting data through communication channels, such as surveys | user testing | conducting interviews with clients to assess what their needs are | direct observation of the project in action if the project has already been through one or two loops | . In an iterative process, this stage can also include a reflection aspect on ways the project could improve or why something isn’t working. With every repetition, the questions to investigate and reflect on change, becoming more specific over time. Designing Code The design phase of the development phase details how to accomplish the goals of the program. This design phase may include: - brainstorming - planning and story-boarding - organizing the program into modules and functional components - creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface - developing a testing strategy for the program . Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is userfocused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking | The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation | A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer.

What Is Agile Methodology in Project Management? . The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders. . Agile methodologies overview . The Agile Manifesto of Software Development put forth a groundbreaking mindset on delivering value and collaborating with customers when it was created in 2001. Agile’s four main values are: . Individuals and interactions over processes and tools | Working software over comprehensive documentation | Customer collaboration over contract negotiation | Responding to change over following a plan | . | . Skills . Creativity Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical Thinking ability to take a step back and look at things more critically ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ | ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking? | . | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | . | Collaboration | Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment. Be knowledgeable and speak to the technical things that you are learning.

This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hey! This is Ananya&quot;); . Hey! This is Ananya . console.log output showing use of variable .

Hello how are you! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function.

Hello how are you! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. .

Reuse of logIT Hello Everyone! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;Namaste&quot;); // String logItType(2022); // Number logItType([1,11,26,9,10]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; Namaste number ; 2022 object ; [ 1, 11, 26, 9, 10 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable student var student = new Person(&quot;Ananya&quot;, &quot;Gaurav&quot;, 2025); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(student); // before role logItType(student.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with student student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); // set the role logItType(student); logItType(student.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Ananya&#39;, ghID: &#39;Gaurav&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Ananya&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;Gaurav&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:2025,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Ananya&#39;, ghID: &#39;Gaurav&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Ananya&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;Gaurav&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:2025,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Student&#34;} .

            "content": "What is JavaScript and why do we use it! . JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user . JavaScript Variables . When to Use JavaScript var? . Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst. . The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. . The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. . If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var. . console.log(z) var x = &quot;Ananya&quot;; var y = &quot; is 15&quot;; var z = x + y; . Ananya is 15 . console.log(e) var a = 5; var b = 6; var c = 1; var d = 8; var e = a + c + d + b . 20 . JavaScript Math! . Math.round(4.6); . 5 . Math.round(4.4); . 4 . Math.round(1.4) . 1 . This rounds up to the nearest intger . Math.ceil(-4.2); . -4 . Math.ceil(4.2); . 5 . This round down to the nearest integer . Math.floor(4.9); . 4 . Math.floor(-6.8); . -7 . Constant Objects and Arrays . The keyword const does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value. Because of this you can NOT: . Reassign a constant value | Reassign a constant array | Reassign a constant object | . But you CAN: . Change the elements of constant array | Change the properties of constant object | . // You can create a constant array: const fruits = [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;]; // You can change an element: fruits[1] = &quot;mango&quot;; // You can add an element: fruits.push(&quot;grapes&quot;); fruits.push(&quot;kiwi&quot;); . 5 .",

My dad taught many things and also gave me resoucres such as udemy and w3schools. I also took online classes with my friends where we did little projects togetehr and showed off our skills. . Taking this class and what I have leanred . Although I had already leanred lists, dictionaries, tuples, ect, there were still many things that I have learned so far. I didn&#39;t know anything about github or vscode. After taking this class, I have learned how to make my own blog and commit changes. This week I learned how to make changes without commiting the changes I make on vscode.

In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | Notes: . The main difference between primitive and reference type is that primitive type always has a value, it can never be null but reference type can be null, which denotes the absence of value. | Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name. | . print(&quot;Hi!

List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;Name&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nickname:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nickname&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nationality:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nationality&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Born?:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Born?&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Eye_Color:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Eye_Color&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite_Food:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Favorite_Food&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Sibling:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Sibling&quot;]) print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in peopleInfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Ananya Nickname: Aisha Age: 15 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pasta Sibling: Rashi, Rashi Nickname: Gauri Age: 11 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pizza Sibling: Ananya, . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(peopleInfoDb): record = peopleInfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Ananya Nickname: Aisha Age: 15 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pasta Sibling: Rashi, Rashi Nickname: Gauri Age: 11 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pizza Sibling: Ananya, . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(peopleInfoDb): record = peopleInfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Ananya Nickname: Aisha Age: 15 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pasta Sibling: Rashi, Rashi Nickname: Gauri Age: 11 Nationality: Indian Born?: India Eye_Color: Brown Favorite_Food: Pizza Sibling: Ananya, .

            "content": "Basic vocabulary of Version Control . Few basic terms that are used often when discussing about version control (not exhaustive). . Repository = a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example). . | Commit = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms ‘commit’ or ‘checkin’ can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing. . | Revision / version = A revision or a version is any change in made in any form to a document(s). Clone = Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions. . | Pull / push = Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update. . | Merge = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. . | . Python Data Types . Variable is a way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define. . Data types . Integer (int) = Whole number | Float (float) = Decimal number | String (str) = Text | Boolean (bool) = True / False | List (list) = A “container” that can store any kind of values. You can create a list with square brackets e.g. [1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]. | Tuple (tuple) = A similar “container” as list with a difference that you cannot update the values in a tuple. You can create a tuple with parentheses (1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;). | . | .",

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Mortensen&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;October 21&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;jmortensen@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;2015-Fusion&#39;, &#39;2011-Ranger&#39;, &#39;2003-Excursion&#39;, &#39;1997-F350&#39;, &#39;1969-Cadillac&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Sunny&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Naidu&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;August 2&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Temecula&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;snaidu@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;4Runner&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner .",

At the end of Weeks 0-3, students will be exposed to blogging with GitHub Pages; developing with Jupyter Notebooks, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and Code.org AppLab; working with AP classroom and becoming familiar with Create Performance Task project requirements. . Introduction to Web Development . Websites are made up of three key parts: Frontend, Backend, and Deployment. The focus for these weeks is to enable students to perform all the aspects of constructing constructing and deploying a Website. Fastpages got us started on these concepts, but now we will build a Website from the ground up. Once again, there will be a lot of learning focused tools and getting things working. But, in the end, students will be ready to learn all aspects of Website Development. . Fundamental of Programming and Algorithms . The tough solutions to problems in Computer Science generally require an algorithm. Each algorithm usually involves data, for instance Data Science is a field that focuses on data with algorithms. The next few week focuses on some very detailed algorithms, but we hope to express these details visually with our Web and Blogging capabilities. Data and binary are sometimes considered boring, but we produce data with analytics or learn to alter the internals of images, the data and algorithms can become VERY interesting. .",

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . My hobbies .
