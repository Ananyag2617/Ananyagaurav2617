            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... | an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . My Notes: . A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. | After executing, it will return to the original call and finish the statements. | In order to determine what the result of a procedure is, you need to carefully examine the code line by line | A procedure MAY or MAY NOT return a value (a number or boolean (true or false)). | Before we start writing the procedure, we need to know what arguments the procedures require and and what type of data the procedure will return. | We need to be able to call the procedure. | To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure (there may not be parameters, but parenthesis must be there). | A procedure is a named block of code that performs a specific task, but does not return a value. The procedure can be called by another part of the program. A procedure for a login menu could be written like this: Pseudocode. Python. | . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: . A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | . Parameters: . Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments: | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called Modularity: | . Procedural Abstraction: . What are some other names for procedures?: . Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language | . Why are procedures effective?: . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . n = int(input(&quot;Please input a number&quot;)) def convertToBinary(n): return (bin(n)[2:]) convertToBinary(n) . &#39;101101&#39; . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . numA = int(input(&quot;Please inout a number:&quot;)) numB = int(input(&quot;Please inout a number:&quot;)) def findmax(numA,numB): if numA &gt; numB: print(&quot;You inputed the numbers &quot; + str(numA) + &quot; and &quot; + str(numB) + &quot; out of these two numbers&quot; + str(numA) + &quot; is greater than &quot; + str(numB)) elif numA &lt; numB: print(&quot;You inputed the numbers &quot; + str(numA) + &quot; and &quot; + str(numB) + &quot; out of these two numbers &quot; + str(numA) + &quot; is less than &quot; + str(numB)) else: print(&quot;Please input a number&quot;) findmax(numA,numB) . You inputed the numbers 45 and 65 out of these two numbers 45 is less than 65 . I did the js version in the other link I provided . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . text = &quot;APCSP&quot; def charToBinary(text): binary = [convertToBinary(ord(c)) for c in list(text)] return binary print(charToBinary(text)) .

A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order An element is a unique, individual value in a list | A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements | Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex - - representation of the values such as a table | Python | JavaScript | . | . What is data abstraction? . Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without refrencing the specific elements of the representation | Data Abstraction makes it easier to implement, develop and maintain code | . | .

The past 3 weeks of grading were challenging, but in the end they have helped me a lot with recognizing what collegeboard expects from student and what they don’t. It has made me realize that including the actual code and running it, the written response is equally as important, and that the written response is graded a lot harder than the video. Over these weeks I feel like I have improved as most og my scores match with collegeboard, however sometimes I realize that i’m a little too generous with points, as in today’s grading I gave the 1st student a 5/6 when it was supposed it be 3/6, or for the 4th student I gave a 6/6, when it was supposed to be 5/6.

Performance Task Scoring week 2 was a little easier than before, because I was a a lot more familiarized with the content, although im still trying to understand each expectation and making sure to spot it in the video or written response of the student. Something I realized that sometimes I gave the same grade as collegeboard, but not for the same reason. Sometimes I missed a point and took or gave a point for a different reason. Another thing i’m trying still struggling with, is quickly identifying what the person did wrong in their response or sometimes overthinking. For the next time I will keep checking the rubric as i’m grading instead of checking it once in the beginning. . Student 1 Grading . My Grade: 1/6 . CB Grade: 1/6 .

I was also surprised many times when I saw that the collegeboard score was same/different from mine, like for example for the first submission, for the first question when I checked the collegeboard score I was kind of surprised, because I was grading a little easy thinking that the person had included everything, but when I looked at the explanation, I realized that it’s a lot more in depth than I had though. Furthermore for the first question I was surprised that the person didnt earn the full point because when I had went through their written response, I thought they had everthing included.

Express, “What would you code given absolute freedom? If I were given the absolute freedom to code whatever I wanted, I would code an app where the user would answer a few questions regarding their health and receive what type of disease or medical problem they are facing. Additionally they would receive recommended medical treatment or medication. In addition to this app I would also code a diet plan app where the user can again answer a few questions regarding their goals and what they would like to achieve in terms of their weight/health. After answering the questions, basically taking a survey and would get a diet plan and an exercise plan that would fit best for them and help them achieve their goal. Their progress would be stored and even show how far they have reached and what they still have left to do in order to reach their goal. . | What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want? My teammates and the idea to help people with my code would motivate me to be productivive. I would want to code something that could possibly even change the world or help the people around me in some way, so the thought of that would motivate me. Also the idea of successfully completing the project and achieving that sense of pride and accomplishment would drive me to achieve my goal. . | How would you measure success in your team? In terms of teamwork, I would say if all of the teammates worked together to solve conflicting problems instead of leaving it to one person solving it and making sure everyone’s opinions and ideas are integrated into the project and taken into consideration would measure the success in our team. I would also say that having patience is the biggest key, because it takes time to achieve goals and if we are not patient with each other and the project itself then it would lead to failure. . | In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation People find motivation in different ways, but I believe if you are constantly reminded about your goals and challenge yourself and think about what you would achieve when completing the project, it would motivate you to keep going. Personally for me, I like to surround myself with people who support me and my goals and push me to keep going. Additionally, celebrating even the smallest achievement keeps me motivated, because every step and change is important. . |",

            "content": "The Basics For Python . categories: [week1] | . Basic vocabulary of Version Control . Few basic terms that are used often when discussing about version control (not exhaustive). . Repository = a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example). . | Commit = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms ‘commit’ or ‘checkin’ can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing. . | Revision / version = A revision or a version is any change in made in any form to a document(s). Clone = Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions. . | Pull / push = Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update. . | Merge = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. . | . . UNIT 2 VOCAB . Bits A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch. The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1. However, the state might also be represented by yes/no, on/off or true/false. | . | Bytes In most computer systems, a byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long. A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol. Each byte can hold a string of bits that need to be used in a larger unit for application purposes. | . | Hexadecimal / Nibbles A nibble can also be represented by a hexadecimal digit. Hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system that uses the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F to represent data, including nibbles and bytes. Figure 1 shows each possible bit combination in a nibble, along with its hexadecimal and decimal equivalent. | . | Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]. The signed integer is represented in twos complement notation. The most significant byte is 0 and the least significant is 3. | . | Signed Integer A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]. The signed integer is represented in twos complement notation. | . | Floating Point A floating point number, is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. For example, 5.5, 0.25, and -103.342 are all floating point numbers, while 91, and 0 are not. Floating point numbers get their name from the way the decimal point can &quot;float&quot; to any position necessary. | . | . | Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean In computer science, a Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false . For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops). | . | . | ASCII ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes. | . | Unicode Unicode is the universal character encoding used to process, store and facilitate the interchange of text data in any language while ASCII is used for the representation of text such as symbols, letters, digits, etc. in computers | . | RGB RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Levels of R, G, and B can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity. | . | . c = &#39;p&#39; print(&quot;The ASCII value of &#39;&quot; + c + &quot;&#39; is&quot;, ord(c)) . The ASCII value of &#39;p&#39; is 112 . bytesArr = bytearray(b&#39; x00 x0F&#39;) # Bytearray allows modification bytesArr[0] = 255 bytesArr.append(255) print(bytesArr) . bytearray(b&#39; xff x0f xff&#39;) . print(&quot;The hexadecimal form of 23 is &quot; + hex(23)) print(&quot;The hexadecimal form of the &quot; &quot;ascii value is &#39;a&#39; is &quot; + hex(ord(&#39;a&#39;))) print(&quot;The hexadecimal form of 3.9 is &quot; + float.hex(3.9)) . The hexadecimal form of 23 is 0x17 The hexadecimal form of the ascii value is &#39;a&#39; is 0x61 The hexadecimal form of 3.9 is 0x1.f333333333333p+1 . Python Data Types . Variable is a way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define. . Data types . Integer (int) = Whole number | Float (float) = Decimal number | String (str) = Text | Boolean (bool) = True / False | List (list) = A “container” that can store any kind of values. You can create a list with square brackets e.g. [1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]. | Tuple (tuple) = A similar “container” as list with a difference that you cannot update the values in a tuple. You can create a tuple with parentheses (1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;). | . | . Variables . A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it . x = 5 y = &quot;Ananya&quot; print(x) print(y) . 5 Ananya . Data Types . Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. . x = 5 print(type(x)) . &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; . Lists . Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. . thislist = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] print(thislist) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;cherry&#39;] . Dictionaries . Dictionaries are .Python&#39;s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value . Algorithms . Python algorithms are a set of instructions that are executed to get the solution to a given problem. Since algorithms are not language-specific, they can be implemented in several programming languages. No standard rules guide the writing of algorithms . myfamily = { &quot;child1&quot; : { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Emil&quot;, &quot;year&quot; : 2004 }, &quot;child2&quot; : { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Tobias&quot;, &quot;year&quot; : 2007 }, &quot;child3&quot; : { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Linus&quot;, &quot;year&quot; : 2011 } } . Sequence . In Python, sequence is the generic term for an ordered set. There are several types of sequences in Python, the following three are the most important. Lists are the most versatile sequence type. . Selection . In Python, the selection statements are also known as decision making statements or branching statements. The selection statements are used to select a part of the program to be executed based on a condition. . Iteration . Repetitive execution of the same block of code over and over is referred to as iteration. There are two types of iteration: Definite iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. . Expressions . In programming language terminology, an “expression” is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value, as opposed to a “statement” which is just a standalone unit of execution and doesn&#39;t return anything. . Comparison Operators . A comparison operator in python, also called python relational operator, compares the values of two operands and returns True or False based on whether the condition is met . Booleans Expressions and Selection . A boolean expression (or logical expression) evaluates to one of two states true or false. Python provides the boolean type that can be either set to False or True. Many functions and operations returns boolean objects. The not keyword can also be used to inverse a boolean type. . Charcters . Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string. . Strings . Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string. . a = &quot;&quot;&quot;HELLO HELLO HELLOHELLO HELLOHELLOHELLO &quot;&quot;&quot; print(a) . HELLO HELLO HELLOHELLO HELLOHELLOHELLO . a = &quot;Hello&quot; print(a) . Hello . Length Concatenation . Concatenation means joining strings together end-to-end to create a new string. To concatenate strings, we use the + operator. Keep in mind that when we work with numbers, + will be an operator for addition, but when used with strings it is a joining operator. . Boolean Values . In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False. You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False. . print(10 &gt; 9) print(10 == 9) print(10 &lt; 9) . True False False . Python Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values: . print(10 + 5) . 15 . Tuple . Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. . thistuple = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;) print(thistuple) . (&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;cherry&#39;) . Python Conditions and If statements . Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: . Equals: a == b | Not Equals: a != b | Less than: a &lt; b | Less than or equal to: a &lt;= b | Greater than: a &gt; b | Greater than or equal to: a &gt;= b | These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in &quot;if statements&quot; and loops. | . An &quot;if statement&quot; is written by using the if keyword. . a = 33 b = 200 if b &gt; a: print(&quot;b is greater than a/&quot;) . b is greater than a/ . Python Loops . Python has two primitive loop commands: while loops for loops . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) i += 1 . 1 2 3 4 5 . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) if i == 3: break i += 1 . 1 2 3 . Function . A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. . def my_function(): print(&quot;Hello from a function&quot;) . Python ascii() Function . The ascii() function returns a readable version of any object (Strings, Tuples, Lists, etc). The ascii() function will replace any non-ascii characters with escape characters: å will be replaced with xe5 . More Vocab . Python For What Are For Loops? In the context of most data science work, Python for loops are used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) and perform the same action for each entry. For example, a for loop would allow us to iterate through a list, performing the same action on each item in the list. While loops with Range | . | You can use the range() method. Note: the values are from 0 to 4, not 0 to 5. The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at the specified number. In the above example, we start from 10, we terminate at 25 and we increment by 5. with List | . | List. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Combining loops with conditionals to Break | . | In Python, the break statement provides you with the opportunity to exit out of a loop when an external condition is triggered. You&#39;ll put the break statement within the block of code under your loop statement, usually after a conditional if statement. Continue | . | The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop. The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops. Procedural Abstraction | . | The name of the function becomes an abstraction that can be used as we reason through a complex program. Our program becomes a more manageable set of functions, instead of a flat sequence of thousands of statements. It is easier to understand, build, and maintain Python Def procedures | . | A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name. We can call the block of code from anywhere in the program to execute the instructions it contains. We can also pass values to the procedure to change how it works. Parameters | . | Parameters in python are variables — placeholders for the actual values the function needs. When the function is called, these values are passed in as arguments. For example, the arguments passed into the function . Return Values | . | The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function&#39;s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. | . | . thislist = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] print(thislist) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;cherry&#39;] . a = 33 b = 200 if b &gt; a: print(&quot;b is greater than a&quot;) . b is greater than a . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) if i == 3: break i += 1 . 1 2 3 . i = 0 while i &lt; 6: i += 1 if i == 3: continue print(i) . 1 2 4 5 6 . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) i += 1 else: print(&quot;i is no longer less than 6&quot;) . 1 2 3 4 5 i is no longer less than 6 . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for x in fruits: print(x) . apple banana cherry . for x in &quot;banana&quot;: print(x) . b a n a n a . def my_function(): print(&quot;Hello from a function&quot;) my_function() . Hello from a function . Booleans Expressions and Iteration: Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator (ex: AND, OR, XOR) containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator. | . | Truth Tables A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, p and q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents. | . | Characters: Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string. | .",

A function can return data as a result. . def my_function(): print(&quot;Hello from a function&quot;) . Python ascii() Function . The ascii() function returns a readable version of any object (Strings, Tuples, Lists, etc). The ascii() function will replace any non-ascii characters with escape characters: å will be replaced with xe5 . More Vocab . Python For What Are For Loops? In the context of most data science work, Python for loops are used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) and perform the same action for each entry. For example, a for loop would allow us to iterate through a list, performing the same action on each item in the list. While loops with Range | . | You can use the range() method. Note: the values are from 0 to 4, not 0 to 5. The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at the specified number. In the above example, we start from 10, we terminate at 25 and we increment by 5. with List | . | List. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Combining loops with conditionals to Break | . | In Python, the break statement provides you with the opportunity to exit out of a loop when an external condition is triggered. You&#39;ll put the break statement within the block of code under your loop statement, usually after a conditional if statement. Continue | . | The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop. The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops. Procedural Abstraction | . | The name of the function becomes an abstraction that can be used as we reason through a complex program. Our program becomes a more manageable set of functions, instead of a flat sequence of thousands of statements. It is easier to understand, build, and maintain Python Def procedures | . | A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name. We can call the block of code from anywhere in the program to execute the instructions it contains. We can also pass values to the procedure to change how it works. Parameters | . | Parameters in python are variables — placeholders for the actual values the function needs. When the function is called, these values are passed in as arguments. For example, the arguments passed into the function . Return Values | . | The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function&#39;s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. | . | . thislist = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] print(thislist) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;cherry&#39;] . a = 33 b = 200 if b &gt; a: print(&quot;b is greater than a&quot;) . b is greater than a . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) if i == 3: break i += 1 . 1 2 3 . i = 0 while i &lt; 6: i += 1 if i == 3: continue print(i) . 1 2 4 5 6 . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) i += 1 else: print(&quot;i is no longer less than 6&quot;) . 1 2 3 4 5 i is no longer less than 6 . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for x in fruits: print(x) . apple banana cherry . for x in &quot;banana&quot;: print(x) . b a n a n a . def my_function(): print(&quot;Hello from a function&quot;) my_function() . Hello from a function . Booleans Expressions and Iteration: Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator (ex: AND, OR, XOR) containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator. | . | Truth Tables A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, p and q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents. | . | Characters: Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string. | .",

Notes . Algorithm efficiency relates to how many resources a computer needs to expend to process an algorithm. The efficiency of an algorithm needs to be determined to ensure it can perform without the risk of crashes or severe delays. If an algorithm is not efficient, it is unlikely to be fit for its purpose. | One way to measure the efficiency of an algorithm is to count how many operations it needs in order to find the answer across different input sizes. | A good algorithm is correct, but a great algorithm is both correct and efficient. The most efficient algorithm is one that takes the least amount of execution time and memory usage possible while still yielding a correct answer. | In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on the usage of different resources. | Quicksort. Quicksort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, and this makes of it one of the most used as well. The first thing to do is to select a pivot number, this number will separate the data, on its left are the numbers smaller than it and the greater numbers on the right. | . Challenge .

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import random as ran random_number = ran.randint(1,1000) print(random_number) . 917 . import math as m p = m.sqrt(9) print(p) . 3.0 . from math import sqrt, factorial print(sqrt(625)) print(factorial(11)) . 25.0 39916800 . import sys as s # importing sys.path print(s.path) .

Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . Here is the code I used for my turtle drawing! . &quot;&quot;&quot; This is the Template Repl for Python with Turtle. Python with Turtle lets you make graphics easily in Python. Check out the official docs here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html &quot;&quot;&quot; import turtle t = turtle.Turtle() for i in range(0, 3): for c in [&#39;cyan&#39;,&#39;navy&#39;,&#39;violet&#39;]: t.color(c) t.forward(100) # draw base t.left(120) t.forward(100) t.left(120) t.forward(100) t.forward(50) t.right(60) t.forward(50) t.right(120) t.up() t.right(90) t.forward(95) t.down() for b in range(4): t.right(90) t.forward(10) t.circle(10) . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | returns the next highest integer ex: 5.8 -&gt; 9 | . floor(x) | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns greatest least common multipe of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * import math as m a = float(input(&quot;Please enter a number:&quot;)) b = float(input(&quot;Please enter a number:&quot;)) print(&quot;The numbers you have entered are: &quot; + str(a) + &quot; and &quot; + str(b)) print( str(a) + &quot; rounded up is &quot; + str(ceil(a))) print(str(b) + &quot; rounded up is &quot; + str(ceil(b))) print( str(a) + &quot; rounded down is &quot; + str(floor(a))) print(str(b) + &quot; rounded down is &quot; + str(floor(b))) print(&quot;The gcm of the two numbers is &quot; + str(gcd(ceil(a), ceil(b)))) print(&quot;The factorial of &quot; + str(a) + &quot; is &quot; + str(factorial(floor(a)))) print(&quot;The factorial of &quot; + str(b) + &quot; is &quot; + str(factorial(floor(b)))) print(&quot;The sqaure of &quot; + str(a) + &quot; is &quot; + str(sqrt(a))) print(&quot;The sqaure of &quot; + str(b) + &quot; is &quot; + str(sqrt(b))) print(&quot;The remainder of the two numbers is &quot; + str(fmod(a,b))) . The numbers you have entered are: 5.5 and 2.5 5.5 rounded up is 6 2.5 rounded up is 3 5.5 rounded down is 5 2.5 rounded down is 2 The gcm of the two numbers is 3 The factorial of 5.5 is 120 The factorial of 2.5 is 2 The sqaure of 5.5 is 2.345207879911715 The sqaure of 2.5 is 1.5811388300841898 The remainder of the two numbers is 0.5 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . For this hack I did the first option, instead of finding the difference between two random dates . &quot;&quot;&quot; This is the Template Repl for Python with Turtle. Python with Turtle lets you make graphics easily in Python.

            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute?

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 .

The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . numb = int(input(&quot;Please enter a postive number:&quot;)) print(numb) while numb != 1: if numb % 2 ==0: numb = numb/2 print(numb) else: numb = ((numb*3)+1) print(numb) . 20000000 10000000.0 5000000.0 2500000.0 1250000.0 625000.0 312500.0 156250.0 78125.0 234376.0 117188.0 58594.0 29297.0 87892.0 43946.0 21973.0 65920.0 32960.0 16480.0 8240.0 4120.0 2060.0 1030.0 515.0 1546.0 773.0 2320.0 1160.0 580.0 290.0 145.0 436.0 218.0 109.0 328.0 164.0 82.0 41.0 124.0 62.0 31.0 94.0 47.0 142.0 71.0 214.0 107.0 322.0 161.0 484.0 242.0 121.0 364.0 182.0 91.0 274.0 137.0 412.0 206.0 103.0 310.0 155.0 466.0 233.0 700.0 350.0 175.0 526.0 263.0 790.0 395.0 1186.0 593.0 1780.0 890.0 445.0 1336.0 668.0 334.0 167.0 502.0 251.0 754.0 377.0 1132.0 566.0 283.0 850.0 425.0 1276.0 638.0 319.0 958.0 479.0 1438.0 719.0 2158.0 1079.0 3238.0 1619.0 4858.0 2429.0 7288.0 3644.0 1822.0 911.0 2734.0 1367.0 4102.0 2051.0 6154.0 3077.0 9232.0 4616.0 2308.0 1154.0 577.0 1732.0 866.0 433.0 1300.0 650.0 325.0 976.0 488.0 244.0 122.0 61.0 184.0 92.0 46.0 23.0 70.0 35.0 106.0 53.0 160.0 80.0 40.0 20.0 10.0 5.0 16.0 8.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . def sqrt(num): if(num==0): return 0 low = 1 high = num//2 while(low&lt;=high): mid = low+(high-low)//2 if(mid*mid ==num): return mid if(mid*mid&lt; num): low=mid+1 answers = mid else: high = mid-1 return answers print(sqrt(4)) . 2 . from math import sqrt as sq test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): for i in range(len(test_cases)): if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) checkValid() .

After arriving at the classroom, me and my team worked on our project a little bit, because we were having trouble with our game and because we were going to be presenting. Screenshots: . After we presented our game, I went back to the classroom and looked at other people’s projects. . Projects I looked at . Project 1 . The first one that I looked at was this emotion test project. Basically you choose an emotion you are feeling and it outputs songs according to your emotion. I really liked this project, because I really liked the idea of it and I was amazed with the songs that came out. . Project 2 . The second project I looked at was a group from my class. They built a dictionary, and they had a search bar where you could eneter the word and it would output the defination. I also liked that they had a word of the day that changed everyday. . Art pieces from different classes . After looking at a few projects around the classroom, me and ekam went to the 3D animation, ceramics, studio art,drawing and painting classrooms to view all the amazing artwork the students had created. As I was going around looking at the different pieces of artwork, I was really inspired and it made me want to join the class too. After seeing all the art, I am definalty going to be taking an art class next year. Here are the some of the pieces we saw. . Art 1 . . Art 2 . . Art 3 . . Art 4 . . Art 5 . . Art 6 . . Art 7 . . Art 8 . . Ideas for next tri . Some ideas I have for next tri are: . math calculator | personality quiz | GPA calculator | a game, maybe hangman | guess the word quiz | 20 questions game | . What are some things I would improve? . For this tri, my team did a great job, we had great frontend coding, however our backend part was a little hard. We were having trouble connecting the frontend with the backend. For next time, I am going to plan things better, and not procrasinate. I will also talk to my future team to have meetings outside of school once in a while. .",

Computer simulations can be limited and have bias . Example: We can assume that when a car is moving, there will be people in it, which is a proper bias to make. But, a simulation may have a bias on which cars will be chosen to simulate a crash. | Computer simulation examples: games | rolling dice | spinners | Molecular models | Analyze chemicals/reactions | For air traffic control To test and find what is the optimal number of aircrafts that should be in the air at once. ### Simulations | . | . | Will not always have the same result | They investigate a phenomenon without real-world constraints of time, money, or safety | Holding a real experiment would most likely result in more accurate results | A simulation can model real-world events that aren’t practical to hold experiments for Ex. the air traffic control example-- not very safe or practical to hold an experiment with expensive and dangerous equipment ### Question 1 An environmental researcher has been conducting a study on the population of hawks in the area in order to predict the number of hawks that will occur in the upcoming year. She created a computer model using data from the past five years. The simulation predicted 42 hawks in the area, but only 29 appeared. Which of the following strategies will be the LEAST likely to offer a more accurate result? | Gathering more data from previous years | Consider adding more data on other species in the area | Taking into consideration changing weather pattern in the area | Remove more data and calculations so the simulation can run faster ### Recap | Simulations are abstractions of complex situations done for a specific purpose | Simulations provide opportunities to study and make predictions when experiments are not feasible for many reasons to include: cost, safely, and accessibility | A simulation uses and represents varying sets of data to reflect the changing state of a phenomenon | Developing abstract simulations involve removing details or simplifying functionality | Simulations can be done without the constraints of the real-world | Simulations can have bias | Simulations can refine previous results and hypothesis ### Question 2 The transportation department would like to build an elevated train system that will route through 3 cities. The transportation department wants to administer a simulation of this train system before construction begins. WHich of the following statements is true about the use of this simulation for the project? | The simulation may reveal possible safety issues that can be corrected before construction begins | The simulation is not needed because other elevated train systems exist. | A simulation cannot be used to test the train system in different weather conditions | The simulation will add high costs to the project. ### Question 3 Which of the following scenarios would be the LEAST beneficial to have as a simulation? | A retail company wants to identity the item which sold the most on their website | A restaurant wants to determine if the use of robots will increase efficiency | A sports bike company wants to study design changes to their new bike design | . Plan . Talk about what similulations are, essential key points, and why and how they are used. What makes these a simulation? | What are the simplifications they make? Why? | What are the assumptions? | What are the benefits of running a simulation over the real thing? | What are the detriments? | How can you get closer to the “actual” results? | . | Show how simualtions can recreate an aspect of our physical world with examples | Watch a video? | Show them a few sample simulations | Hacks .

            "content": "This is the result I got after taking the final test. . Screenshots: . Questions I missed . These are the questions I missed on the test. I missed a total of 9 questions, there were times when I didn’t understand or know the answer to some questions, so I would go back to the collegeboard lessons and review the topic. After taking the test, I realized that I didn’t struggle much on the questions that involved code and the basics of coding. . Screenshots: . Question 2 . For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong because when x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. The correct answer is C because when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and the value of y is displayed. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. . . Question 3 . For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong because collaboration that includes diverse backgrounds and perspectives can reflect the strengths of the individual team members. The correct answer is A because the need for software testing is not eliminated, even with effective collaborators. Testing ensures that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. . . Question 4 . For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong the usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists are not needed. Since Alejandra is organizing the meal, only her contact list is used.The correct answer is A because each group member’s list of food allergies or dietary restrictions is needed for the application to determine which restaurants can accommodate all members of the group. Alejandra’s geographic location is needed so that the application can determine which restaurants are nearby. The usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists are not needed. Since Alejandra is organizing the meal, only her contact list is used. . . Question 8 . For this question I put A as my answer. This answer is wrong because the value of j does not need to be between 0 and k. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive. The correct answer is B because the procedure creates a copy of numList called newList. The element at newList[j] is assigned the element at numList[k], and the element at newList[k] is assigned the element at numList[j]. Therefore, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements at indices j and k are interchanged. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive. . . Question 14 . For this question we had to pick two answers and I only picked one (B) which was one of the right answers. The other right answer is D. These two answers are right because when numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed instead of the intended “check minus” and when numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore “check minus” is displayed instead of the intended “check plus”. . . Question 18 . For this question I picked B which is wrong because the Internet is not a data stream. The right answer is C because the Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet. . . Question 35 . For this question we had to pick two answers but I picked only one of the right answers which was A I believe, the other right answer was D. These two are right because this code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120 and plus this code segment uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. . . Question 39 . For this question I kind of rushed and misread the question. I picked B, but this is wrong because while the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. The correct answer is D because list indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. . . Question 49 . For this question I picked the answer B, but this is wrong because this code segment produces the string “onon”. The correct answer is C because this code segment assigns “on” to word. It then concatenates the reverse of word (“no”) with word (“on”), producing the intended string “noon”. . . These were all the question I got wrong.

Terms and Usage . A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git). | A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes. | A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database.

However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository. | To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud.

For example, a program outputs a result different from the expected value, like saying that three times three equals thirty-three. . Syntax Errors: . A syntax error occurs when the rules of the programming language aren&#39;t followed. Any typos in your code, such as forgetting to close a parentheses or spelling a variable wrong, will cause an error. Fortunately, many code editors will point out syntax errors, making them one of the easier errors to solve. . Run-Time Errors: . An error that occurs when the program is running. You&#39;ll be able to start your program if you have a run-time error, but something will go wrong when you&#39;re trying to use it. Logic errors are examples of run-time errors. . Overflow Errors: . An error that occurs when a computer tries to handle a number that&#39;s outside of its defined range of values. Usually, this means that your computer&#39;s trying to handle a number too big for it . How to fix errors . Here are some effective ways to identify, find and correct errors. Good testing procedures include testing with valid and invalid data. You want to make sure your program works with valid data and knows what to do if invalid data is imputed. | You should also test boundary cases, or values on the edge of program limits. This is where errors are likely to happen. For example, if your program only accepts values less than 9, you would check 8 and 10 as boundary cases. | . | Hand tracing, or manually tracking what values your variables have as your program goes along. Many hand tracing methods use charts to organize these values. | Using debuggers, or programs designed specially to test for bugs | Adding extra print statements to your code to make sure that the &quot;invisible&quot; steps (the ones that aren&#39;t shown as output) are working properly. | .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . My API example . This is an API I thought would be great for my group project . import requests url = &quot;https://translated-mymemorytranslation-memory.p.rapidapi.com/createkey&quot; headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;2d79bbde22mshed34d34c65d8472p1365cejsn7594c6e54840&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;translated-mymemorytranslation-memory.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) print(response.text) . {&#34;key&#34;:&#34;cb1c8fb463230162cc6d&#34;,&#34;error&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;code&#34;:200,&#34;id&#34;:&#34;MyMemory_b794d151c9451d35ee5c&#34;,&#34;pass&#34;:&#34;6721c7ce6f&#34;} .

Key Points . 1.3: Daily Video 1In this video, we will learn that computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose. | 1.3: Daily Video 2In this video, we will learn that programs are developed by groups of people and new programs are often written by expanding on the programs already written by others. | 1.3: Daily Video 3In this video, we will learn that programmers use comments and/or documentation to explain the purpose of their program code to themselves, collaborators, and others. | . Key Takeaways . A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature. | There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: | § investigating and reflecting | § designing | § prototyping | § testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process | A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program | Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observation | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and functional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . Topic 1.3, Daily Video 2 . - Acknowledge someone who created the code segment you’re building off of - Programs are rarely solo endeavors - Write their name or origin in documentation or comments - Many times developers use code segments, algorithms, procedures, and more that are written by others - Similar to quoting in research papers - If you’re using someone else’s code segment for your program, acknowledge and quote that author’s name or origin in documentation or comments as it is their intellectual property . Topic 1.3, Daily Video 3 . Programs are created by: - describe the overall program - list program specifications describe: - functions/procedures/methods within the code - specific code segments - list of events and corresponding outputs - the development of the program - how other programs may interact with the code - List of contributors/authors of the other programs - Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: - At the beginning: list specifications - During: to keep track of the process - After: to explain the overall process - Documentation throughout can improve: - Efficiency of overall programing process - Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program - Programmers’ response to bugs and errors - How do programmers document while programming? - Commenting feature - commenting is only featured and allows in some programming languages - commenting doesn’t affect code or text . Summaries from Videos . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required. | It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author’s name | . Ways Programmers Investigate: . collecting data through communication channels, such as surveys | user testing | conducting interviews with clients to assess what their needs are | direct observation of the project in action if the project has already been through one or two loops | . In an iterative process, this stage can also include a reflection aspect on ways the project could improve or why something isn’t working. With every repetition, the questions to investigate and reflect on change, becoming more specific over time. Designing Code The design phase of the development phase details how to accomplish the goals of the program. This design phase may include: - brainstorming - planning and story-boarding - organizing the program into modules and functional components - creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface - developing a testing strategy for the program .

Vocab for Agile Methodology and CSP . scrum master- manage scrum board and ensure agile framework is followed, track issues and looks for opportunities for team to improve . | DevOps- combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase a team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity . | Frontend Developer- develops what users interact with . | Backend Developer- develops what goes on behind the scenes, what the user doesn’t see, technical stuff . | . What Is Agile Methodology in Project Management? . The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders. . Agile methodologies overview . The Agile Manifesto of Software Development put forth a groundbreaking mindset on delivering value and collaborating with customers when it was created in 2001. Agile’s four main values are: . Individuals and interactions over processes and tools | Working software over comprehensive documentation | Customer collaboration over contract negotiation | Responding to change over following a plan | . | . Skills . Creativity Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical Thinking ability to take a step back and look at things more critically ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ | ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking? | . | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | . | Collaboration | Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment. Be knowledgeable and speak to the technical things that you are learning.

The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hey! This is Ananya&quot;); . Hey! This is Ananya . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. .

Hello how are you! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(mymsg); . Hello how are you! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. .

Reuse of logIT Hello Everyone! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;Namaste&quot;); // String logItType(2022); // Number logItType([1,11,26,9,10]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable student var student = new Person(&quot;Ananya&quot;, &quot;Gaurav&quot;, 2025); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(student); // before role logItType(student.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with student student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); // set the role logItType(student); logItType(student.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Ananya&#39;, ghID: &#39;Gaurav&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Ananya&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;Gaurav&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:2025,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Ananya&#39;, ghID: &#39;Gaurav&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Ananya&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;Gaurav&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:2025,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Student&#34;} .

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user . JavaScript Variables . When to Use JavaScript var? . Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst. . The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. . The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. . If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var. . console.log(z) var x = &quot;Ananya&quot;; var y = &quot; is 15&quot;; var z = x + y; . Ananya is 15 . console.log(e) var a = 5; var b = 6; var c = 1; var d = 8; var e = a + c + d + b . 20 . JavaScript Math! . Math.round(4.6); . 5 . Math.round(4.4); . 4 . Math.round(1.4) . 1 . This rounds up to the nearest intger . Math.ceil(-4.2); . -4 . Math.ceil(4.2); . 5 . This round down to the nearest integer . Math.floor(4.9); . 4 . Math.floor(-6.8); . -7 . Constant Objects and Arrays . The keyword const does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value. Because of this you can NOT: . Reassign a constant value | Reassign a constant array | Reassign a constant object | . But you CAN: . Change the elements of constant array | Change the properties of constant object | . // You can create a constant array: const fruits = [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;]; // You can change an element: fruits[1] = &quot;mango&quot;; // You can add an element: fruits.push(&quot;grapes&quot;); fruits.push(&quot;kiwi&quot;); . 5 .",

Insights . Insight one: . This enterprise is possible and we don’t have to be stuck at what well-being we’re at. We can control our happiness more than we think ## Insight two: | We think that like where we live, our career, and salary matter but in reality they only matter a tiny bit. different people have various circumstances | we shouldn’t be depressed if other people have more happy things in their life than us | we predict what will make us happy, but it can turn out to be wrong or something unexpected ## Insight three: | We sure can control our happiness but it requires some hard work | Ways to gain happiness (according to research) Make a goal | Put in commitment and hard work | Make permanent changes to thing you do | Ex. Analogy of exercise we must practice exercises an hour or so each day | Stop eating excessive amount of junk food but not necessarily stop | Listening to lectures and not applying effort won’t fix anything | A growth mindset is needed and putting in work to fulfill our desire of happiness ## Insight four: | . | . | Recognizing and admitting that many times your intuitions and mind can be lying about the definition of happiness | things can appear like that but we sometimes have to learn they’re not truthful ## Insight five: | Helping others with money makes us more happier rather than using money all for ourselves | Happy people use money for other people and care for them | it’s much more powerful than we think it is | .

            "content": "Notes/Takeaway . - Students tend to have misnomers about college - They expect it to be all stressful and anxiety levels rise - they’re not able to experience and have a good outlook on the new opportunities they have. - Students feel so overwhelmed that even when they get small pleasures like reading a book, they only complete their homework and don’t even feel those small pleasures - classify their work into groups. - Statistics show that 40 percent of college students report more than the average level of stress - The science of being less stressed and more optimistic comes from two domains: - Domain of positive psychology, which literally studies happy people - the domain of behavior change and how we make decisions. . Insights . Insight one: . This enterprise is possible and we don’t have to be stuck at what well-being we’re at. We can control our happiness more than we think ## Insight two: | We think that like where we live, our career, and salary matter but in reality they only matter a tiny bit. different people have various circumstances | we shouldn’t be depressed if other people have more happy things in their life than us | we predict what will make us happy, but it can turn out to be wrong or something unexpected ## Insight three: | We sure can control our happiness but it requires some hard work | Ways to gain happiness (according to research) Make a goal | Put in commitment and hard work | Make permanent changes to thing you do | Ex. Analogy of exercise we must practice exercises an hour or so each day | Stop eating excessive amount of junk food but not necessarily stop | Listening to lectures and not applying effort won’t fix anything | A growth mindset is needed and putting in work to fulfill our desire of happiness ## Insight four: | . | . | Recognizing and admitting that many times your intuitions and mind can be lying about the definition of happiness | things can appear like that but we sometimes have to learn they’re not truthful ## Insight five: | Helping others with money makes us more happier rather than using money all for ourselves | Happy people use money for other people and care for them | it’s much more powerful than we think it is | . Summary: . Sometimes students can be overwhelmed from what they expect about college to be, that they miss the small pleasures and opportunities. There are various ways to be happy and express our happiness for others. It requires some effort, but it’s worth it. It surely requires a growth mindset and not being around a negative environment.

In middle school I took programming as my elective and did that for two years. When the pandemic hit, thats when I started getting serious about programming and learned the basics of python. My dad taught many things and also gave me resoucres such as udemy and w3schools. I also took online classes with my friends where we did little projects togetehr and showed off our skills. . Taking this class and what I have leanred . Although I had already leanred lists, dictionaries, tuples, ect, there were still many things that I have learned so far. I didn&#39;t know anything about github or vscode. After taking this class, I have learned how to make my own blog and commit changes. This week I learned how to make changes without commiting the changes I make on vscode. I am really excited to see what I learn as the weeks go on, because I quite surprised with what I have learned in these past weeks, .",

Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | Notes: . The main difference between primitive and reference type is that primitive type always has a value, it can never be null but reference type can be null, which denotes the absence of value. | Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name. | . print(&quot;Hi!

List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;Name&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nickname:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nickname&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nationality:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nationality&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Born?:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Born?&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Eye_Color:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Eye_Color&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite_Food:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Favorite_Food&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Sibling:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Sibling&quot;]) print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in peopleInfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(peopleInfoDb): record = peopleInfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(peopleInfoDb): record = peopleInfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "content": "Basic vocabulary of Version Control . Few basic terms that are used often when discussing about version control (not exhaustive). . Repository = a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example). . | Commit = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms ‘commit’ or ‘checkin’ can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing. . | Revision / version = A revision or a version is any change in made in any form to a document(s). Clone = Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions. . | Pull / push = Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update. . | Merge = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. . | . Python Data Types . Variable is a way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define. . Data types . Integer (int) = Whole number | Float (float) = Decimal number | String (str) = Text | Boolean (bool) = True / False | List (list) = A “container” that can store any kind of values. You can create a list with square brackets e.g. [1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]. | Tuple (tuple) = A similar “container” as list with a difference that you cannot update the values in a tuple. You can create a tuple with parentheses (1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;). | . | .",

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

At the end of Weeks 0-3, students will be exposed to blogging with GitHub Pages; developing with Jupyter Notebooks, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and Code.org AppLab; working with AP classroom and becoming familiar with Create Performance Task project requirements. . Introduction to Web Development . Websites are made up of three key parts: Frontend, Backend, and Deployment. The focus for these weeks is to enable students to perform all the aspects of constructing constructing and deploying a Website. Fastpages got us started on these concepts, but now we will build a Website from the ground up. Once again, there will be a lot of learning focused tools and getting things working. But, in the end, students will be ready to learn all aspects of Website Development. . Fundamental of Programming and Algorithms . The tough solutions to problems in Computer Science generally require an algorithm. Each algorithm usually involves data, for instance Data Science is a field that focuses on data with algorithms. The next few week focuses on some very detailed algorithms, but we hope to express these details visually with our Web and Blogging capabilities. Data and binary are sometimes considered boring, but we produce data with analytics or learn to alter the internals of images, the data and algorithms can become VERY interesting. .",
