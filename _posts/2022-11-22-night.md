# My experience...
After arriving at the classroom, me and my team worked on our project a little bit, because we were having trouble with our game and because we were going to be presenting.

After we presented our game, I went back to the classroom and looked at other people's projects.

# Projects I looked at

## Project 1
The first one that I looked at was this emotion test project. Basically you choose an emotion you are feeling and it outputs songs according to your emotion. I really liked this project, because I really liked the idea of it and I was amazed with the songs that came out.

## Project 2
The second project I looked at was a group from my class. They built a dictionary, and they had a search bar where you could eneter the word and it would output the defination. I also liked that they had a word of the day that changed everyday.

# Art pieces from different classes
After looking at a few projects around the classroom, me and ekam went to the 3D animation, ceramics, studio art,drawing and painting classrooms to view all the amazing artwork the students had created. As I was going around looking at the different pieces of artwork, I was really inspired and it made me want to join the class too. After seeing all the art, I am definalty going to be taking an art class next year.
Here are the some of the pieces we saw.

# Ideas for next tri

Some ideas I have for next tri are:
- math calculator
- personality quiz
- GPA calculator
- a game, maybe hangman
- guess the word quiz
- 20 questions game


# What are some things I would improve?
For this tri, my team did a great job, we had great frontend coding, however our backend part was a little hard. We were having trouble connecting the frontend with the backend. For next time, I am going to plan things better, and not procrasinate. I will also talk to my future team to have meetings outside of school once in a while.
