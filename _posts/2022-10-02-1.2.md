Key Points
- 1.2: Daily Video 1
    -  all computing innovations are developed for a purpose and this purpose guides the development of the program.
- 1.2: Daily Video 2
    -  computer programs take inputs in a variety of fashions to influence the program's behavior.
- 1.2: Daily Video 3
    - computer program is a collection of statements that are executed according to the rules of the programming language.

Key Takeaways from 1.2

Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is userfocused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample 
room for experimentation and risk-taking
- The purpose of computing innovations is to 
solve problems or to pursue interests through 
creative expression. 
- An understanding of the purpose of a 
computing innovation provides developers with 
an improved ability to develop that computing 
innovation
- A program is a collection of program 
statements that performs a specific task when 
run by a computer. A program is often referred 
to as software
- A code segment is a collection of program 
statements that is part of a program.
- A program needs to work for a variety of inputs 
and situations.
- The behavior of a program is how a program 
functions during execution and is often 
described by how a user interacts with it
- A program can be described broadly by what 
it does, or in more detail by both what the 
program does and how the program statements 
accomplish this function
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for 
processing by a program. Input can come in a 
variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, 
or text.
 
 # Program Function and Purpose 
## Topic 1.2, Daily Video 1
- Categories of Innovations
    - Applications
        - Games
        - Social Media
        - Business
        - Productivity
    - Physical Devices
        - Computers
        - Smart phones/tablets
    - Systems
        - Cloud Services
        - E-mail
        - E-commerce

- Social Media Applications
    - It allows users from around the world to communicate easily without any issues such as mailing
    - Be updated and know other peoples’ lifestyle
    - Socialize and connect online
- E-commerce
    - Allows users from any part of world to buy something they require or need
    - It is efficient and doesn’t require traveling
    - It isn’t time consuming, just add to your cart and save


## Topic 1.2, Daily Video 2
- Computer Programs different inputs
    - Tactile (touch)
    - Audio
    - Visual
    - Text (numerical & alpha)
- Programs are written in an event driven environment. 
    - Events are usually actions taken or triggered that usually sends input
    - mouse clicks
    - screen taps/swipes (force touch)  
    - keyboard entries
- Input affects output in programs
    - Outputs produced by a device
        - visual
        - audio
        - tactile (touch)
        - Text
- If an event occurs or is triggered, the program jumps to the code segment similar to an if else conditional
- Even if several lines of code are written, the program doesn’t have to necessarily execute in that order

## Topic 1.2, Daily Video 3
- What are programs?
    - A collection of statements
    - A  statement is a single command
    - Group of statements is called a code segment
    - Code segments execute based on what the input is
- For example if you’re given a code such as finding the minimum value in a list, it would individually check using conditional statements. Then, it would execute a program depending on what the input of the list is
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for 
processing by a program. Input can come in a 
variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, 
or text. 
- An event is associated with an action and 
supplies input data to a program.
- Events can be generated when a key is pressed, 
a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any 
other defined action occurs that affects the 
flow of execution
- Inputs usually affect the output produced by a 
program. 
- In event-driven programming, program 
statements are executed when triggered rather 
than through the sequential flow of control.
- Input can come from a user or other programs.
