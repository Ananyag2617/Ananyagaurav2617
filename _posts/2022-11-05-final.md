### These are the questions I missed on the test. I missed a total of 9 questions, but it wasn't like I knew the questions I didn't miss really well. After taking the test, I realized that I didnt struggle much on the questions thar involved code and the basics of coding.

### For this question I put D as my answer. This answer is wrong because when x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. The correct answer is C because when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and the value of y is displayed. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed.
