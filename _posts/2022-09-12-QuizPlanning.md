<h1 id="Guess-the-next-lyrics-quiz">Guess the next lyrics quiz<a class="anchor-link" href="#Guess-the-next-lyrics-quiz"> </a></h1><p>Concept of my quiz:</p>
<p>For my quiz I added 4 questions for each level. There are 2 levels, Easy and Hard, the player gets to choose which level they would like to be quizzed on. As they first start the quiz, the song that they are being questioned on will play along, and when they move on to the next question, the song will change accordingly.</p>

<h1 id="Problems-Encountered-and-Making-the-Quiz">Problems Encountered and Making the Quiz<a class="anchor-link" href="#Problems-Encountered-and-Making-the-Quiz"> </a></h1><p>There were many problems I had while making this quiz. I had trouble downloading the songs into code.org, because it would take a long time and sometimes would even fail. My quiz would fail because I didnt add the correct name of the button or slide. Sometimes I had missing code in between several, so I would have to go back and find what was wrong. Making the quiz was a little hard because I had trouble choosing what topic to do and organizing all the questions and code.</p>
