# Our project was related to food, and our features included a nutrition analyser, quiz, recipe finder, and recipe generator.

# I believe that our presentations were successful, because our code was working and we were able to demonstrate our work without any errors, and people seemed to really enjoy each feature.

# Something I would improve in terms of my feature would definetly be to  connect a table to the output box, so as soon as the user inputs ingrediants and presses enter, the data is stored in a table.

# After we presented, I went to my friends in different periods and looked at their works.

# One of my favorite presentations was the wordle game, as we had attempted to do that last tri, but because we had some code missing, the project was incomplete, so I was happy that it was successfully comepleted by one of my previous teammates.

# I also saw band perform and I really enjoyed watching them play several amazing pieces, and it felt nice after such a busy day.

# I also saw many art pieces, from ceramics and AP art. I was really inspired by everything I saw, as all the artworks were really beautiful and really showed how much effort students put in. Since I really liked the art/ceramics art work, I decided to take AP art next year.
