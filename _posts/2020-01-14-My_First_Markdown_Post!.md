# First Markdown Post
THIS IS MY FIRST MARKDOWN POST!

## Welcome to my first post. 

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`2022-08-22.MyFirstPost.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## My hobbies

Playing the piano, Classical Indian Dance, Python Programming, Chess
