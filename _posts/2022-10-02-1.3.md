Key Points
- 1.3: Daily Video 1In this video, we will learn that computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose.
- 1.3: Daily Video 2In this video, we will learn that programs are developed by groups of people and new programs are often written by expanding on the programs already written by others.
- 1.3: Daily Video 3In this video, we will learn that programmers use comments and/or documentation to explain the purpose of their program code to themselves, collaborators, and others.

Key Takeaways
- A development process can be ordered and 
intentional, or exploratory in nature.
- There are multiple development processes. 
    - The following phases are commonly used when 
    developing a program:
    - § investigating and reflecting 
    - § designing 
    - § prototyping 
    - § testing
- A development process that is iterative requires 
refinement and revision based on feedback, 
testing, or reflection throughout the process. 
This may require revisiting earlier phases of the 
process
- A development process that is incremental is 
one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces 
and makes sure each piece works before adding 
it to the whole
- The design of a program incorporates 
investigation to determine its requirements.
- Investigation in a development process is 
useful for understanding and identifying the 
program constraints, as well as the concerns 
and interests of the people who will use the 
program
- Some ways investigation can be performed are 
as follows: 
    - collecting data through surveys
    - user testing 
    - interviews 
    - direct observation
- Program requirements describe how a program 
functions and may include a description of user 
interactions that a program must provide
- A program’s specification defines the 
requirements for the program. 
- In a development process, the design phase 
outlines how to accomplish a given program 
specification.
- The design phase of a program may include: 
    - planning and storyboarding
    - organizing the program into modules and 
    functional components
    - creation of diagrams that represent the 
    layouts of the user interface
    - development of a testing strategy for the 
program


# Summaries from Videos
- Program documentation is a written description 
of the function of a code segment, event, 
procedure, or program and how it was 
developed
- Comments are a form of program 
documentation written into the program to 
be read by people and do not affect how a 
program runs.
- Programmers should document a program 
throughout its development
- Program documentation helps in developing 
and maintaining correct programs when 
working individually or in collaborative 
programming environments.
- Not all programming environments 
support comments, so other methods of 
documentation may be required.
- It is important to acknowledge any code 
segments that were developed collaboratively 
or by another source
- Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) 
written by someone else and used in a program 
can be in the program documentation. The 
acknowledgement should include the origin or 
original author’s name

# Ways Programmers Investigate:
- collecting data through communication channels, such as surveys
- user testing
- conducting interviews with clients to assess what their needs are
- direct observation of the project in action if the project has already been through one or two loops

In an iterative process, this stage can also include a reflection aspect on ways the project could improve or why something isn't working. With every repetition, the questions to investigate and reflect on change, becoming more specific over time.
Designing Code
The design phase of the development phase details how to accomplish the goals of the program.
This design phase may include:
    - brainstorming
    - planning and story-boarding
    - organizing the program into modules and functional components
    - creating diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    - developing a testing strategy for the program

- Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is userfocused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample 
room for experimentation and risk-taking
- The purpose of computing innovations is to 
solve problems or to pursue interests through 
creative expression. 
- An understanding of the purpose of a 
computing innovation provides developers with 
an improved ability to develop that computing 
innovation
- A program is a collection of program 
statements that performs a specific task when 
run by a computer. A program is often referred 
to as software
- A code segment is a collection of program 
statements that is part of a program.
- A program needs to work for a variety of inputs 
and situations.
- The behavior of a program is how a program 
functions during execution and is often 
described by how a user interacts with it
- A program can be described broadly by what 
it does, or in more detail by both what the 
program does and how the program statements 
accomplish this function
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for 
processing by a program. Input can come in a 
variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, 
or text.

# How to make comments in different languages:
    - Python (#)
    - Java (// - single line; /* */ - multiple lines; /** **/ - multiple line documentation)
    - Javascript, C/C++, Swift - also use something similar to Java
    - XML/HTML (<!-- -->)
    - Applescript/Pascal (* *)
    - block-based languages use pop-outs for comments
