<h1 id="Takeaways-and-what-I-learned-from-the-two-videos.">Takeaways and what I learned from the two videos.<a class="anchor-link" href="#Takeaways-and-what-I-learned-from-the-two-videos."> </a></h1><p>After watching the videos, I realized that collaboration is really important when you want to improve and get far in things. We should realize that we all are different and have different perspectives, and with different people, we have different backgrounds. And these diversites among is very helpful when creating a computing innovation. 
Some ways to make collaboration team succesful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate kindly and often.</li>
<li>Practice consensus building within your team by listening to every member within it and taking their perspectives into consideration.</li>
<li>Create norms such as establishing team roles or policies to help mediate any conflicts that might arise.</li>
<li>A team project is a team effort, and that means everyone in the group needs to have a say. Sometimes, that might mean compromise.</li>
