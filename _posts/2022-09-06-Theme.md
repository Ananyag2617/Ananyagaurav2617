## The Problems 
After I changed the theme of my blog, I noticed my blog change from this:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/"csp3.png")
To this:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/csp2.png" width="1000" height="600"> 

As you can see, before changing my theme, the menu bar of my website along with the pages linked to it were gone.
Before:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/csp4.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
After: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/csp2.png" width="1000" height="600">
Next, I also noticed that the features I added for my text was also changed.
Before:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/csp5.png" width="1000" height="600">
After:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/csp2.png" width="1000" height="600">
