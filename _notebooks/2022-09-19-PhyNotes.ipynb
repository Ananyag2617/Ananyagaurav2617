    "Sometimes students can be overwhelmed from what they expect about college to be, that they miss the small pleasures and opportunities. There are various ways to be happy and express our happiness for others. It requires some effort, but it’s worth it. It surely requires a growth mindset and not being around a negative environment. We should also be grateful for what we have and not compare ourselves to others, because that will lower down our hopes."
