    "# Terms and Usage\n",
    "-  A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git).\n",
    "- A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes.\n",
    "- A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database. Git commits over time are a series of Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA’s). This is the math behind a git snapshot.\n",
    "- The .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree (ie files constructed from source or derived files, like ipynb files that turn into md files).\n",
    "- The “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository.\n",
    "- To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable.\n",
    "- Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository.\n",
    "- A “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch.\n"
