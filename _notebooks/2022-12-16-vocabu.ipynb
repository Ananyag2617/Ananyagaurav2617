    "* Repository = a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Commit = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms ‘commit’ or ‘checkin’ can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.\n",

    "Clone = Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pull / push = Copy revisions from one repository into another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update.\n",

    "- Bits \n",
    "    - A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch. The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1. However, the state might also be represented by yes/no, on/off or true/false.\n",
    "- Bytes \n",
    "    - In most computer systems, a byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long. A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol. Each byte can hold a string of bits that need to be used in a larger unit for application purposes.\n",
    "- Hexadecimal / Nibbles \n",
    "    -  A nibble can also be represented by a hexadecimal digit. Hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system that uses the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F to represent data, including nibbles and bytes. Figure 1 shows each possible bit combination in a nibble, along with its hexadecimal and decimal equivalent.\n",
    "- Binary Numbers: \n",
    "    - Unsigned Integer \n",
    "        - An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]. The signed integer is represented in twos complement notation. The most significant byte is 0 and the least significant is 3.\n",
    "    - Signed Integer\n",
    "     - A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]. The signed integer is represented in twos complement notation.\n",
    "    - Floating Point\n",
    "     - A floating point number, is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. For example, 5.5, 0.25, and -103.342 are all floating point numbers, while 91, and 0 are not. Floating point numbers get their name from the way the decimal point can \"float\" to any position necessary.\n",
    "- Binary Data Abstractions:\n",
    "    - Boolean\n",
    "        - In computer science, a Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false . For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops).\n",
    "- ASCII \n",
    "    - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.\n",
    "- Unicode \n",
    "    - Unicode is the universal character encoding used to process, store and facilitate the interchange of text data in any language while ASCII is used for the representation of text such as symbols, letters, digits, etc. in computers\n",
    "- RGB\n",
    "    -  RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Levels of R, G, and B can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity."

    "    - What Are For Loops? In the context of most data science work, Python for loops are used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) and perform the same action for each entry. For example, a for loop would allow us to iterate through a list, performing the same action on each item in the list.\n",
    "- While loops with Range \n",
    "    - You can use the range() method. Note: the values are from 0 to 4, not 0 to 5. The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at the specified number. In the above example, we start from 10, we terminate at 25 and we increment by 5.\n",
    "-  with List\n",

    "- Combining loops with conditionals to Break\n",
    "    - In Python, the break statement provides you with the opportunity to exit out of a loop when an external condition is triggered. You'll put the break statement within the block of code under your loop statement, usually after a conditional if statement.\n",
    "- Continue\n",
    "    - The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop. The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops.\n",
    "- Procedural Abstraction\n",
    "    - The name of the function becomes an abstraction that can be used as we reason through a complex program. Our program becomes a more manageable set of functions, instead of a flat sequence of thousands of statements. It is easier to understand, build, and maintain\n",
    "- Python Def procedures\n",
    "    - A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name. We can call the block of code from anywhere in the program to execute the instructions it contains. We can also pass values to the procedure to change how it works.\n",
    "- Parameters\n",
    "    - Parameters in python are variables — placeholders for the actual values the function needs. When the function is called, these values are passed in as arguments. For example, the arguments passed into the function .\n",
    "- Return Values\n",
    "    - The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function's return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit."

    "- Booleans Expressions and Iteration: \n",
    "    - Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met\n",

    "- Characters: Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string."
