<p>After arriving at the classroom, me and my team worked on our project a little bit, because we were having trouble with our game and because we were going to be presenting.
Screenshots:

<p>After we presented our game, I went back to the classroom and looked at other people’s projects.</p>

<h2 id="project-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#project-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project 1</h2>
<p>The first one that I looked at was this emotion test project. Basically you choose an emotion you are feeling and it outputs songs according to your emotion. I really liked this project, because I really liked the idea of it and I was amazed with the songs that came out.

<a class="anchor" href="#project-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project 2</h2>
<p>The second project I looked at was a group from my class. They built a dictionary, and they had a search bar where you could eneter the word and it would output the defination. I also liked that they had a word of the day that changed everyday.

<a class="anchor" href="#art-pieces-from-different-classes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Art pieces from different classes</h1>
<p>After looking at a few projects around the classroom, me and ekam went to the 3D animation, ceramics, studio art,drawing and painting classrooms to view all the amazing artwork the students had created. As I was going around looking at the different pieces of artwork, I was really inspired and it made me want to join the class too. After seeing all the art, I am definalty going to be taking an art class next year.
Here are the some of the pieces we saw.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#ideas-for-next-tri" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ideas for next tri</h1>

<p>Some ideas I have for next tri are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>math calculator</li>
  <li>personality quiz</li>
  <li>GPA calculator</li>
  <li>a game, maybe hangman</li>
  <li>guess the word quiz</li>
  <li>20 questions game</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-some-things-i-would-improve" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are some things I would improve?</h1>
<p>For this tri, my team did a great job, we had great frontend coding, however our backend part was a little hard. We were having trouble connecting the frontend with the backend. For next time, I am going to plan things better, and not procrasinate. I will also talk to my future team to have meetings outside of school once in a while.</p>
