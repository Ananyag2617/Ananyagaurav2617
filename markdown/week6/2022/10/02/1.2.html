<p>Key Points</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.2: Daily Video 1
    <ul>
      <li>all computing innovations are developed for a purpose and this purpose guides the development of the program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.2: Daily Video 2
    <ul>
      <li>computer programs take inputs in a variety of fashions to influence the program’s behavior.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.2: Daily Video 3
    <ul>
      <li>computer program is a collection of statements that are executed according to the rules of the programming language.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Key Takeaways from 1.2</p>

<p>Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is userfocused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample 
room for experimentation and risk-taking</p>
<ul>
  <li>The purpose of computing innovations is to 
solve problems or to pursue interests through 
creative expression.</li>
  <li>An understanding of the purpose of a 
computing innovation provides developers with 
an improved ability to develop that computing 
innovation</li>
  <li>A program is a collection of program 
statements that performs a specific task when 
run by a computer. A program is often referred 
to as software</li>
  <li>A code segment is a collection of program 
statements that is part of a program.</li>
  <li>A program needs to work for a variety of inputs 
and situations.</li>
  <li>The behavior of a program is how a program 
functions during execution and is often 
described by how a user interacts with it</li>
  <li>A program can be described broadly by what 
it does, or in more detail by both what the 
program does and how the program statements 
accomplish this function</li>
  <li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for 
processing by a program. Input can come in a 
variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, 
or text.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Computer Programs different inputs
    <ul>
      <li>Tactile (touch)</li>
      <li>Audio</li>
      <li>Visual</li>
      <li>Text (numerical &amp; alpha)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Programs are written in an event driven environment.
    <ul>
      <li>Events are usually actions taken or triggered that usually sends input</li>
      <li>mouse clicks</li>
      <li>screen taps/swipes (force touch)</li>
      <li>keyboard entries</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Input affects output in programs
    <ul>
      <li>Outputs produced by a device
        <ul>
          <li>visual</li>
          <li>audio</li>
          <li>tactile (touch)</li>
          <li>Text</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If an event occurs or is triggered, the program jumps to the code segment similar to an if else conditional</li>
  <li>Even if several lines of code are written, the program doesn’t have to necessarily execute in that order</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>What are programs?
    <ul>
      <li>A collection of statements</li>
      <li>A  statement is a single command</li>
      <li>Group of statements is called a code segment</li>
      <li>Code segments execute based on what the input is</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For example if you’re given a code such as finding the minimum value in a list, it would individually check using conditional statements. Then, it would execute a program depending on what the input of the list is</li>
  <li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for 
processing by a program. Input can come in a 
variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, 
or text.</li>
  <li>An event is associated with an action and 
supplies input data to a program.</li>
  <li>Events can be generated when a key is pressed, 
a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any 
other defined action occurs that affects the 
flow of execution</li>
  <li>Inputs usually affect the output produced by a 
program.</li>
  <li>In event-driven programming, program 
statements are executed when triggered rather 
than through the sequential flow of control.</li>
  <li>Input can come from a user or other programs.</li>
</ul>
