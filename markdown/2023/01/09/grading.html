<p>Since it was my first time grading and following a collegboard criteria and assignment, I did struggle a little throughout this whole grading process, because I had to constantly go back to the criteria to check what they expected. I was also surprised many times when I saw that the collegeboard score was same/different from mine, like for example for the first submission, for the first question when I checked the collegeboard score I was kind of surprised, because I was grading a little easy thinking that the person had included everything, but when I looked at the explanation, I realized that it’s a lot more in depth than I had though. Furthermore for the first question I was surprised that the person didnt earn the full point because when I had went through their written response, I thought they had everthing included. But they didn’t since they didn’t state the actual purpose. This grading was challenging but it did open my eyes to the expectations collegboard has, additionaly it also made it clear for me how not explaining the purpose looks like and how it is supposed to look like.</p>

<h1 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Express, “What would you code given absolute freedom?
If I were given the absolute freedom to code whatever I wanted, I would code an app where the user would answer a few questions regarding their health and receive what type of disease or medical problem they are facing. Additionally they would receive recommended medical treatment or medication. In addition to this app I would also code a diet plan app where the user can again answer a few questions regarding their goals and what they would like to achieve in terms of their weight/health. After answering the questions, basically taking a survey and would get a diet plan and an exercise plan that would fit best for them and help them achieve their goal. Their progress would be stored and even show how far they have reached and what they still have left to do in order to reach their goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want?
My teammates and the idea to help people with my code would motivate me to be productivive. I would want to code something that could possibly even change the world or help the people around me in some way, so the thought of that would motivate me. Also the idea of successfully completing the project and achieving that sense of pride and accomplishment would drive me to achieve my goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How would you measure success in your team?
In terms of teamwork, I would say if all of the teammates worked together to solve conflicting problems instead of leaving it to one person solving it and making sure everyone’s opinions and ideas are integrated into the project and taken into consideration would measure the success in our team. I would also say that having patience is the biggest key, because it takes time to achieve goals and if we are not patient with each other and the project itself then it would lead to failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation
People find motivation in different ways, but I believe if you are constantly reminded about your goals and challenge yourself and think about what you would achieve when completing the project, it would motivate you to keep going. Personally for me, I like to surround myself with people who support me and my goals and push me to keep going. Additionally, celebrating even the smallest achievement keeps me motivated, because every step and change is important.</p>
